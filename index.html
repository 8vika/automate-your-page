          Essentially, the World Wide Web is a network that connects computers with servers.  The computers "talk" to servers by sending something called HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) requests.

        <p>
          HTML or Hypertext Markup Language is the standard markup language used to create web pages.  It is written in the form of HTML elements consisting of tags enclosed in angle brackets.

          An HTML tag is always contained within angled brackets.  Most tags have an opening tag and a closing tag.  An element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.

          The browser provides many useful tools for analyzing or creating a webpage.  For example, many of the attributes such as borders, color, font size, etc., can be changed interactively and the result can be viewed in real time.

        <p>
         HTML and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are both languages where HTML controls the placement of content and CSS controls the style (decoration) of content.  Java script is used to control the interactive components on the page.  These languages are organized using something called DOM or Document Object Model into a hierarchical structure resembling a tree.

        Avoiding Repetition
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Avoiding repetition is important for a variety of reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Avoiding Errors:</b> CSS allows a particular style to be applied to several different elements by assigning a class.  This saves time, space, and helps reduce coding errors by eliminating the need for repitition.  Another property called inheritance governs rules which eliminate the need for certain styles to be declared repeatedly.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Consistency:</b> In this web page, I wanted every lesson to look the same. Instead of manually giving each one the same style, I was able to assign each lesson <span class="code">div</span> the same <span class="code">class</span> and then specify the style for that class in only one place! By avoiding repetion, it's now very easy for me to make changes to this style.

        CSS
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and they give programmers a way to control the style of related HTML elements. This is done by giving similar HTML elements the same <span class="code">class</span> name and then specifying the style that should apply to that class.

          <b>I was "That guy":</b> Yes, I was "That guy!"  You know the one!  He's the guy old as dirt that has never done Facebook, Twitter, or even sent a text message with his phone.  Don't text and drive?  What's texting anyways?  My phone can surf the net?  No way!  Won't it short out or something if it gets wet? Yeah, I'm that guy! Then his boss says update your skills or start practicing saying "Welcome to Costco, I love you!"

        <p>
            Then he signed up for Udacity's Introduction to Programming Nanodegree.  He learned how to create accounts to online "stuff" like github.com.  He learned how to <span class="code">link</span> files together and <span class="code">look</span> at HTML code using developer tools.  He used to be SO ashamed that 6 year old's knew more about smart phones, webpages, and the internet than he did, but thanks to Udacity now he knows how to make a snazzy looking golly gee-wiz webpage.  How freagin' cool is that?  There's still a lot of stuff the old giezer doesn't understand, but with Udacity's help he'll get there!  And that is why Udacity ROCKS!

        Understanding Programming
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          To become proficient at programming one must first learn to think like a programmer.  Thinking like a programmer requires more than just investing in a pair or thick glasses and a pocket protector.  To think like a programmer one must master three things: one, procedural thinking; two, technological empathy; and three, abstract thinking.
        </p>  
        <p>
          Computer languages are similar to spoken language in that they employ a set of grammatical rules referred to as syntax.  Python, for example, uses the Backus Normal Form notation technique where commands are given in the form of expression, operator, expression.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some common "got-cha's" and other points to be mindful of in Python are: 1)Always introduce a variable before you use it.  2)Avoid programming bugs by following the convention of never capatalizing variables.  3)String variables must have the same number of quotes on both sides.  4)In addition to using single or double quotes you can also use tripple quotes to create a multi-line string.  5)The plus operator is used to concatenate two strings but can't combine a string and a number.  6)The multiply operator can be used to repeat a string.  7)A single equal operator means assignment and a double equal operator means equality.  8)When Python code crashes the message it gives you is called a "traceback."  The traceback tells you what line crashed and the file that was running.  9)To obtain a precise answer when dividing use a decimal place to invoke floatinig point division.

        Computational Problem Solving
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Abstract thinking is the lion's share of solving any computational problem because you must first <i>understand</i> the problem.  Such problems are defined by possible inputs, possible outputs, and the relationship between them.  So a "solution" is a procedure that takes the inputs and produces the desired outputs.  Many beginners try to immediately translate the problem into code in their heads and get frustrated.  Verterans, on the other hand, employ tools such as psuedo code, simple mechanical algorithms, and think in terms of valid inputs and outputs before attempting to write any code.

        <p>2. What are the outputs?</p>
        <p>3. Work through some examples by hand.</p>
        <p>4. Come up with a simple mechanical solution.</p>

        Understanding Functions
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          Functions are critical to eliminating repetition.  Python has many built in functions, but the true value is being able to define your own functions to perform a particular repetitive task.  When making functions watch for syntax errors, spelling errors, indentation errors, and be aware that calling a procedure without a return does nothing.

        An Introduction to Lists: Mutation versus Aliasing and List Operators
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          There are two major differences between lists and strings: 1) Strings contain only characters whereas lists can contain anything.  2) Lists can support something called Mutation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mutation sounds like the title of a low budget science fiction B-movie. However, in computer science, mutation means you can change the value of a list after you have created it.  For example, the append function mutates the old list by adding an element to the end.  Unlike in B-movies, this change requires no radiation or nuclear explosions.  Conversely, using the plus operator introduces a new list.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aliasing means there are two different ways to refer to the same object.
        </p>
        <p>
          The len function, returns the number of elements in the list.  The index operator, returns the first position where the value is found in the list otherwise it produces an error.  The in operator returns true if the value is contained in the list.

        I See What You Did There!
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          In one of the work exercises before learning about lists we were asked to print out the contents of a string.  We had just learned about while loops, but the instructions in the exercise did not mention we would have to use a while loop to solve the problem.  Unable to immediately compose code for a solution in my head I was tempted to just advance to the solution.  Instead, I thought about the problem, examined the possible inputs and outputs, and looked inside my <i>toolbox</i> for the right tool to solve the problem: a while loop.
        </p>
        <p>
          After solving the problem I reflected on the thought process and had to give kudos to Udacity for making me exercise my abstract thinking skills.  I see what you did there, Udacity; very clever!
